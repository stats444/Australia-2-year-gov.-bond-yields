# Australia-2-year-gov.-bond-yields
Stabel and robust models:
The chow test was applied to decide, if the most promising multivariate OLS model for the 2-year Australian government bond is stable over time. The test was applied in the middle of the sample, so that each dataset would include 126 samples. It was not possible to reject the null hypothesis and there are therefore no break points in the respective OLS model. Having no structural breaks, the R2 and F-statistic can be defined as stable over time. 
Furthermore, a rolling window regression was applied, to identify weather the individual betas change over time. Besides Beta_3 (unemployment rate), the betas can de defined as stable.
